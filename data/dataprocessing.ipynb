    "\n",
    "The GFMS (http://flood.umd.edu ) is a NASA-funded experimental system using real-time TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) precipitation information as input to a quasi-global (50째N - 50째S) hydrological runoff and routing model running on a 1/8th degree latitude/longitude grid. Flood detection/intensity estimates are based on 13 years of retrospective model runs with TMPA input, with flood thresholds derived for each grid location using routed runoff statistics (95th percentile plus parameters related to basin hydrologic characteristics). The intensity value is the calculated water depth above the flood threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Table below shows the details of some of the variable outputs from the GFMS. Currently only the flood intensity (in depth) above threshold is available for public access. All these variables are straight-forwardly written to binary files without any additional operations (i.e. no multiplies) in 4-byte float type for the domain of 50째N - 50째S at 3-hour time step and 1/8th deg. spatial resolution. The dimension and the geo-reference information for the data grid of each file are: row=800, col=2458, xllcorner= -127.25, yllcorner=-50 and cellsize=0.125. The NoData in the files are -9999.\n",
